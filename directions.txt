Take Home Assessment: 
Educational Video Player

Purpose
This task is designed to:
- showcase your skills in web development
- your ability to create a user-friendly and informative UI
- the organization and structure of code you write from scratch. 

This problem is left intentionally vague and open-ended in many regards
- at Scope Labs
    - you will not always be given exact, precise, and detailed specifications for the
functionality you will be implementing. 
    - You will often be responsible for making reasonable design decisions, and determining the precise spec 
      for your work.


The Problem
- You are a software engineer
- You've been hired by an EdTech company 
- They want you to develop a simple web application that:
   - allows users to create, comment on, and watch educational videos
   - interacts with the given backend API and provide a seamless and engaging experience for users
   - The design and UI are up to you to create.
Requirements
- Platform and Technology: React or Next.js as the primary frontend framework
- User Interface: 
   - Design an interface that:
      - is intuitive 
      - is visually appealing
      - considers the educational context
- Use this branding:     
   - [insert link here] 
   - If you would like a Figma file for guidance / inspiration, please reach out to cory@scopelabs.com.
- API Integration: We have set up a very basic server with documentation
   - Use your first and last name snake case as your user_id for creating video objects 
      - (e.g. John Smith: john_smith)
   - Use any fake user_id you would like when making comments
   - You can upload any example video URLs (preferably .mp4 files).

1. Show a list of videos:
  - We show the videos horizontally centered on the screen, and you can scroll down to see more
    - When the screen first loads, we call GET /videos 
       - On success, we render all the videos in the list
          - Assume that videos are in the following format (same as in POST, except there is new video_id) 
            {
               "user_id": "string",
               "description": "string",
               "image_thumbnail": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA...
               "title": "string"
               "video_id": string
            }
          - Each video shown will be shown in a rectangle (a white card)
             - Show the Title centered at the top in bold
             - Show the video author (user_id) underneath the title
             - Show the video and description in a horizontal container 
                - Show the video on the left 
                   - The video will look render the imagge_thumbnail with the word "play" on it 
                   - Once the user clicks on the word "play", we will get
                - Show the description on the right 

             - Show a button called "Comments" that allows the user to view the 
               comments for the video by adding a vertical area below the video 
               and description container 
                   - On click, calls GET /videos/comments?video_id=${video_id} and expands vertical area 
                     of div 
                   - If success
                      - If 1 or more videos, we show the comments in a vertical list 
                        - comments will look like this JSON and be shown a la YouTube, but simpler: 
                        - {
                            user_id: string 
                            video_id: string 
                            comment_text: string 
                            timestamp: string 
                          }
                      - If no videos, we say "There are no comments yet for this video"
                      - Show a button saying "add comment" with a textbox next to it
                         - on click 
                            - if there's no text in the comment, it shows a red error message
                            - it calls POST videos/comments with body 
                            - { 
                                video_id: string
                                content: string
                                user_id: string
                              }
                              - on success - "You commented on the video!"
                              - on failure - "There was a problem sending your comment, please try again later"

                   - If failure, we say "error getting the comments for this list"
       - On failure, we say "there was an error retrieving the videos from the server. Please refresh and try again later"
  - There is a create new videos button centered at the bottom of the screen 
     - When it gets clicked, we show a small form with fields corresponding to the corresponding (we have an upload video file button)
       POST body and a submit button
        - {
            "user_id": "string",
            "description": "string",
            "video_file": ""data:video/mp4;base64,AAAAHGZ0e...",
            "title": "string"
          }
        - If you click the submit button, shows an error if any fields are not filled out 
        - Otherwise calls POST /videos
           - On success, we show a green success message in green
           - If an error occurs, we show red text saying there was an error uploading a video
App Functionality: The website must have the following capabilities:
   ● Show a list of videos
      - allow users to select a video from the list.
   ● Allow the user to create a new video object with: 
      - title
      - description
      - video URL.
   ● comment
      - Allow user to comment on a video 
      - Let users view comments from other users.
         - ??? How to do this?
   ● Open the videos in full screen with full playback functionality.
      - assuming this does not include:
         - closed captions
         - Quality Selection: Change the resolution or quality of the video stream.
         - NOPE Picture-in-Picture Mode (this is actually included apparently)
   ● DONE Include options for adjusting playback speed and volume.
      - Use html5 video


The Solution
  - The aboveoutlines the general functionalities that the application must be able to handle
  - It hwever, intentionally does not provide specifications 
      - those specifications, as well as general system design and organization, are up to you. 
  - An ideal solution will: 
     - follow best practices for componentization and state management, 
     - be well-organized,
     - be well-documented/commented and easy to understand by other engineers.
